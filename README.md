# DataTracker_gproj

Datascience is one of the fastest growing computer science fields, and the process of analyzing large amounts of data on your own can be boring. Taking in video game data from a database API, we'll show you what you can do with it to make it interesting!

For our project we consume data from the API using Flask with Python. Using Chart.js, we came up with some interesting ways to show the data.
